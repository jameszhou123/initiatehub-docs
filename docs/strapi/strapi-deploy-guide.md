# Deploying Strapi with PostgreSQL on a VPS Using Docker Compose

This guide outlines the steps to deploy a Strapi application with PostgreSQL on a VPS using Docker Compose. We'll cover setting up your environment, pushing the Docker image to Docker Hub, and deploying on your VPS.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

1. **Access to Your VPS:**

   - Ensure you have SSH access to your VPS with your user credentials and IP address.

2. **Connecting to the VPS Using SSH:**

   - Use the following command to connect to your VPS. Replace `user` with your VPS username and `your_vps_ip` with the IP address of your VPS:
     ```bash
     ssh user@your_vps_ip
     ```

3. **Install Docker on Your VPS:**

   - After connecting to your VPS, install Docker by running:
     ```bash
     curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
     sudo sh get-docker.sh
     ```
   - This script will automatically install the latest version of Docker on your VPS.

4. **Install Docker Compose:**

   - Install Docker Compose using the following command:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install docker-compose -y
     ```
   - This command installs Docker Compose, which is required to manage multi-container Docker applications like Strapi with PostgreSQL.

5. **Verify Installations:**
   - Check Docker version to ensure it's installed correctly:
     ```bash
     docker --version
     ```
   - Check Docker Compose version:
     ```bash
     docker-compose --version
     ```

## Step 1: Create and Push Docker Image to Docker Hub

In this step, we will first create the Strapi Docker image using a Dockerfile, then push the image to a private Docker Hub repository.

### **1.1: Create the Strapi Docker Image Using a Dockerfile**

1. **Navigate to Your Strapi Project Directory:**

   - Open your terminal and navigate to the root of your Strapi project where your Dockerfile is located:
     ```bash
     cd /path/to/your-strapi-project
     ```

2. **Create a Dockerfile in the Root of Your Project:**

   - Ensure that your Dockerfile is properly set up in the root of your Strapi project. Here’s an example Dockerfile:

     ```yaml
     # Use Node.js 20 as the base image
     FROM node:20

     # Set the working directory inside the container
     WORKDIR /app

     # Copy package.json and package-lock.json first for caching layer
     COPY package*.json ./

     # Install dependencies
     RUN npm install

     # Copy the rest of the application code
     COPY . .

     # Build the Strapi application
     RUN npm run build

     # Expose the port Strapi will run on
     EXPOSE 1337

     # Start the Strapi application
     CMD ["npm", "run", "start"]
     ```

3. **Build the Docker Image:**
   - Run the following command to build the Docker image from the Dockerfile:
     ```bash
     docker build -t your-dockerhub-username/strapi-app:latest .
     ```
   - This command builds the Docker image and tags it as `your-dockerhub-username/strapi-app:latest`. Adjust the tag name according to your preference.

### **1.2: Push Docker Image to Docker Hub**

1. **Log in to Docker Hub:**

   - Use the following command to log in to Docker Hub:
     ```bash
     docker login
     ```
   - Enter your Docker Hub username and password when prompted.

2. **Create a Private Repository on Docker Hub:**

   - Go to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) and log in to your account.
   - Click on the “Repositories” tab and then click “Create Repository.”
   - Set the repository name (e.g., `strapi-app`), ensure the "Private" option is selected, and click "Create."

3. **Tag Your Docker Image for Docker Hub:**

   - Tag your locally built Docker image to match your Docker Hub repository:
     ```bash
     docker tag your-dockerhub-username/strapi-app:latest your-dockerhub-username/strapi-app:latest
     ```
   - Replace `your-dockerhub-username` with your actual Docker Hub username.

4. **Push the Image to Docker Hub:**
   - Push the tagged image to your private repository on Docker Hub:
     ```bash
     docker push your-dockerhub-username/strapi-app:latest
     ```

## Step 2: Prepare Your VPS

1. Connect to your VPS:

   ```bash
   ssh user@your_vps_ip
   ```

   Replace `user` with your VPS username and `your_vps_ip` with the IP address of your VPS.

2. Install Docker and Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   # Install Docker
   curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
   sudo sh get-docker.sh

   # Install Docker Compose
   sudo apt-get install docker-compose -y
   ```

3. Create a directory for your project:

   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /srv/strapi
   sudo chown $USER:$USER /srv/strapi
   cd /srv/strapi
   ```

## Step 3: Update `.env` File

Ensure your `.env` file contains the correct environment variables:

```env
HOST=0.0.0.0
PORT=1337
APP_KEYS= # Auto generated by strapi
API_TOKEN_SALT= # Auto generated by strapi
ADMIN_JWT_SECRET= # Auto generated by strapi
TRANSFER_TOKEN_SALT= # Auto generated by strapi
JWT_SECRET= # Auto generated by strapi
DATABASE_CLIENT=postgres
DATABASE_HOST=postgres
DATABASE_PORT=5432
DATABASE_NAME=strapi_db
DATABASE_USERNAME=strapi_user
DATABASE_PASSWORD=your_password # Replace with your actual password
DATABASE_SSL=false
NODE_ENV=production
```

## Step 4: Create and Configure Docker Compose File

Ensure your `docker-compose.yml` is configured as follows:

```yaml
services:
  strapi:
    image: your-dockerhub-username/strapi-app:latest # Replace with your actual image name
    container_name: strapi-app
    env_file:
      - .env # Load environment variables from the .env file
    ports:
      - "1337:1337" # Map host port 1337 to container port 1337
    depends_on:
      - postgres # Ensures the postgres service is started before strapi
    volumes:
      - ./uploads:/app/public/uploads # Persist media uploads to the host

  postgres:
    image: postgres:16.4
    container_name: strapi-postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: ${DATABASE_USERNAME} # Use variables from .env
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${DATABASE_PASSWORD}
      POSTGRES_DB: ${DATABASE_NAME}
    volumes:
      - ./pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data # Persist PostgreSQL data to the host
    ports:
      - "5432:5432" # Map host port 5432 to container port 5432
```

## Step 5: Copy Your Docker Compose and `.env` Files to the VPS:

**Open a New Terminal on Your Local Machine:**

In a new terminal on your local machine (not the VPS), use the `scp` command to copy the necessary files to your VPS:

```bash
scp docker-compose.yml .env user@your_vps_ip:/srv/strapi
```

## Step 6: Deploy Strapi with Docker Compose

1. Start the Docker Compose services:

   ```bash
   cd /srv/strapi
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. Verify the deployment:

   - Check the status of the containers:

     ```bash
     docker-compose ps
     ```

   - View logs to ensure everything is running correctly:

     ```bash
     docker-compose logs -f
     ```

3. Access Strapi:

   - Open your browser and go to `http://your_vps_ip:1337/admin` to access the Strapi admin panel.
